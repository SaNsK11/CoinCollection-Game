# CoinCollection-Game

This is a coin collection game.In the game, coins will be appaearing and dissapearing. The user has to hover over the coins in order to collect them and increase his score.

This is a simple game built by manipulating JavaScript to write CSS and HTML via JS.
I attended a Bootcamp organised by #CodeForCause wherein I learnt this concept. 

Currently I am looking to add an "END GAME" condition to the game.

Keep you guys posted!
